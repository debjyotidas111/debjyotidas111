    <h1>Dogs</h1>

    <p>The dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is
        derived
        from an ancient, extinct wolf,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.[8] The dog was the first species to be
        domesticated,[9][8] by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[7] before the development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long association with
        humans,
        dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be
        inadequate for
        other canids.[11]p>
